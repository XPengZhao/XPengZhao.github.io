I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/) at the Hong Kong polytechnic University, under the supervising of Dr. [Lei Yang](http://young.tagsys.org/). Previously, I received my B.E. from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/). My research interests focus on AI-driven wireless technologies, including indoor localization, channel prediction, etc.
