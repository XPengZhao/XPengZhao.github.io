I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/) at the Hong Kong  Polytechnic University, under the supervising of Dr. [Lei Yang](http://young.tagsys.org/). Previously, I received my B.E. degree from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/). My primary research interests focus on mobile computing, wireless communication, intelligent sensing, and AI-driven wireless technologies, including indoor localization and wireless channel prediction.

I am going to join the Theory Lab, Huawei HKRC as a researcher.
